# Res-happy

A place to store the hundreds of recipes I have received from various friends and family members.

TO-DO: basically make every bit of front-end look pretty, finish front-end for everything

I am behind schedule. Whoops.

In the future, I want to come back to this project to add features like a category list, where you would only see certain recipes in a single, selected category, as opposed to seeing every recipe at once on one page. I want it to be more organized than it is.
